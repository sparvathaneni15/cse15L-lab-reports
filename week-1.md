# Week 1 Lab Report

**1. Installing Visual Studio Code**


Navigate to the VS Code website [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Here, you will download the version of the software that is appropriate for your machine. VS Code, also known as Visual Studio Code, is a source code editor, used to edit and run programs. I completed this lab on a Windows machine, so I downloaded the Windows version. A macOS version is available on the same website, if you are using a Mac. After downloading the program, you must complete the setup process and customize the application however you desire. Now, you are ready to Open VS code.
